  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>What you should do here, is more or less the same as what you did yesterday with the Car's 'R' Us backend</p>
  <p>This time however, using <code>JavaScript Modules</code> to structure the code and <code>async-await</code> to 
     simplify how we work with <em>promises</em></p>
  <p> <em>MAKE SURE</em> to create a separate file <b>settings.js</b>, and <code>export</code> the URL to your API from here </p>

      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      The concept async wait is that it's a more mordern way to work with asynchronous code in js. It is built on promises, just like chaining .then() calls, but makes it more readable.<br>
      It also makes error handling easier, as it allows you to use try catch inside the method and send any error messages from the backend, to the console or html page.<br><br>
      I have used it in my findCar methods in findCar.js and editCar.js. If the server returns a false on response.ok when calling the fetch, the error is instead sent out.
