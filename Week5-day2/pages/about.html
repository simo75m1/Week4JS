  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>What you should do here, is more or less the same as what you did yesterday with the Car's 'R' Us backend</p>
  <p>This time however, using <code>JavaScript Modules</code> to structure the code and <code>async-await</code> to 
     simplify how we work with <em>promises</em></p>
  <p> <em>MAKE SURE</em> to create a separate file <b>settings.js</b>, and <code>export</code> the URL to your API from here </p>
